# IDP 2024

## Pre-requisites

- The `ArxContainer` library, which can be installed using the Arduino library manager.

## Dev notes

- Since this is an Arduino project, the main file must be named `idp.ino`, the same as the git folder.
- Also, the C++ standard library is not available, so we have to use libraries specifically compatible with Arduino.
- The `.vscode/` folder has been included with some settings that may be useful for development under VSCode.
Any files that are machine-specific have been excluded from the repository using `.gitignore`.
